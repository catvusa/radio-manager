Animals are hunted for population control, food, and trophies. Myslivci (gamekeepers) breed animals in captivity and then release them into nature, preserving the species.",

First of all, the name Mikulas is the Czech equivalent of the Greek name Nikolaos, meaning 'the victory of people' or 'winner among the people,' which may provide some foreshadowing of the story. Mikulas was very a generous and helpful bishop who lived in the 4th century in Greece. During his lifetime, he developed a reputation for being helpful to those in need and putting coins in their shoes. For a great number of miracles, which occurred during his time, he was also called 'Nicholas the Thaumaturge.'",

      content: "One of the strongest Czech traditions, even embodied by national law, is Jmeniny (Name's Day). There is more to this tradition than just simply celebrating your name day on the calendar. Here's a peek behind the curtain. First of all, it's almost exclusively a European holiday. The tradition can find its roots, as with many European traditions, in religion. Specifically, in Christianity. It has been, without a doubt, the dominant religion throughout time across the ever-changing European borders. The Christian tradition of celebrating the patron saints gave the church an opportunity to enhance the official calendar and enable the parishioners and the faithful to worship their saints, day by day, all year round. As expected, the first names in the calendar were of various patron saints. On any given day, not only were the life and deeds of the saint celebrated, but also all the holders of the same name were allowed to celebrate the day as their own. In some Christian communities, one's Name Day may hold even bigger importance than one´s birthday. Many saints held the same name, thus Christian worshipers of the same name may have celebrated their Name Days on different days in the year, depending on which saint they had chosen as their patron saint. The saint’s day is based on the date of their passing. Many Christian calendars may differ from the official John Paul IV´s. Some Christians were also given various names during the act of confirmation or entry to the Order, so they celebrate more Name Days according to the names they bear.",

            description: "Antonin Leopold Dvorak (September 8, 1841 – May 1, 1904) was one of the first Czech composers to achieve widespread international acclaim. He was born in Nelahozeves, near Prague, in what was then the Austrian Empire.He was the first of eleven children born to Frantisek and Anna Dvorak, and he was baptized as a Roman Catholic in his village's church of St. Andrew. His Catholic upbringing and love of Nelahozeves and his Bohemian heritage were to strongly influence his musical career. In 1847, Dvorak entered primary school, where he was taught to play violin by his teacher Joseph Spitz. He showed early talent and skill, playing in a village band and in church. Frantisek, pleased with his son's gifts, sent thirteen-year-old Antonin to Zlonice to live with his uncle Antonin Zdenek in order to learn the German language. Dvorak’s German-language teacher, Anton Liehmann, also taught organ, piano, and violin, and music theory. Liehmann was the church organist in Zlonice and sometimes let Antonin play the organ at services. Dvorak took further organ and music theory lessons at Ceska Kamenice with Franz Hanke, who encouraged his musical talents even further and was more sympathetic. His first composition, the Forget-Me-Not Polka in C (Polka pomnenka) was written possibly as early as 1855.",

            description: "Friedrich Smetana (March 2, 1824 – May 12, 1884), later known as Bedrich Smetana, was born in Litomysl near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, which were then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child and first son of Frantisek Smetana, a moderately wealthy brewer who played violin in a string quartet, and his third wife, Barbora Lynkova, a dancer. Frantisek had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five of whom (all daughters) survived infancy. He and Barbora had ten more children, seven of whom reached adulthood. German was the official language of Bohemia in the nineteenth century, as the region was then under Habsburg rule. Frantisek knew Czech, but for business and social reasons, he rarely used it, and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. In 1835, Frantisek retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia. Because there was no suitable local school, Friedrich was sent to the gymnasium at Jihlava, where he was homesick and unable to study. He then transferred to a school at Nemecky Brod, where he was happier and made good progress. Among the friends he made there was the future Czech revolutionary poet Karel Havlicek, whose departure for Prague in 1838 might have encouraged young Friedrich to pursue life in the capital. The following year, with his father’s approval, he enrolled at Prague's Academic Grammar School under Josef Jungmann, a distinguished poet and linguist who was a leading figure in the Czech national revival.",

His father Ferdinand, a shoemaker, worked as the church sexton and the town’s fire watchman, positions that allowed the family to live in the tower apartment. Bohuslav was a sickly and shy child: his father and older sister frequently had to carry him up the tower’s 193 steps, and he refrained from participating in school activities like plays or pageants. Despite his inauspicious start in life, Martinu developed musical skills at a young age and earned a reputation as a gifted violinist. He was encouraged to pursue his craft by his family and by residents of his hometown. He performed his first public concert in Policka in 1905, and locals raised enough money to fund his studies at the Prague Conservatory, where he began training in 1906. Although he was a brilliant performer, he was not a remarkable student; his inattention to his studies ultimately resulted in his 1910 dismissal from the conservatory and his return to Policka.",
